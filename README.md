I want to play around with graphics under Rust. This is where I will do that. I
have an idea for a game though it is not fully formed yet. I'll see where it
takes me. At the moment I'm getting used to [piston][0] and my code is based on
[this tutorial][1]. So far it is just a spinning square.

At the moment I'm working on image loading (this is more complicated than I
expected) and using a great piece of artwork by [MillionthVector][2].
